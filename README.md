This project is an **AI-based application** developed to demonstrate practical usage of artificial intelligence concepts such as data processing, decision-making, and basic machine learning techniques. The project focuses on applying AI logic to solve a real or simulated problem and present meaningful outputs.

The main goal of this project is to bridge the gap between theoretical AI concepts and real-world implementation using Python and common AI libraries.
